		<p>This page will draw a smooth curve between several points on a graph.</p>
		<p>The graph already has three points on it. Move them around, or add new ones, and see how the curve changes in response.</p>
		<p>
		Instructions:
		<ul>
			<li>Click on the canvas to add points.
			<li>Click and drag a point to move it.
			<li>Drag a point outside the graph or shift-click to delete it.
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The graph is calculated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline">cubic interpolation</a>. This makes sure that the graph is differentiable (no sharp corners) everywhere.</p>
